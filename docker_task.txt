Docker Task:
---

Task:  
1. 
- Run container Ubuntu 
- check the running container 
- Explain Why cann't see the container 
- How we can make the container to be UP and running



2. Create a Dockerfile for the Flask Application (read the code carefully)
- Use the given Python code to create a `Dockerfile` that:
  - Containerizes the Flask app
  - required package: `flask` 
  - Make sure to Path the required ENV 

---

3. Create a Docker Compose File (`docker-compose.yml`)
- Define two containers inside the **Docker Compose file:  
  
  1. Web Container
     - Use the Dockerfile (do NOT build the image outside Docker Compose)  
     - Ensure the web application build and run inside this Docker Compose
     - pass the ENV var   
  
  2. PostgreSQL Container
     - Use the official PostgreSQL image  
     - Mount the database path `/var/lib/postgresql/data` outside the container to persist data  
   
- the web container should be able to reach the database container.  

---

4. Validate Container Communication  
- After running docker-compose, access the web container and execute the following command:  
  apt update && apt install -y postgresql-client && psql -h db -U user -d mydb
  
-Take a screenshot of the output.  

---
5. Verify the Web Application in the Browser  
- Open the Flask web application in your browser (`http://localhost:5000`).  
- Take a screenshot of the running application.

  - `app.py` (Flask application code)  
  - `Dockerfile` (for the Flask app) 
  - `requirement file` 
  - `docker-compose.yml` (Docker Compose configuration) 
  - Dockerfile for Free Palastine App
  - Screenshots of:  
     - The psql command output inside the container  
     - The web application in the browser
